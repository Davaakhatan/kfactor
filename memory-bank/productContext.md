# Product Context: 10x K Factor Viral Growth System

## Why This Project Exists

### Problem Statement
Varsity Tutors has a comprehensive suite of educational products but lacks a systematic approach to viral growth. Current growth likely relies on traditional marketing channels, missing opportunities to:
- Turn satisfied users into advocates
- Create social proof and FOMO through presence/activity
- Leverage moment-of-pride moments (good scores, achievements, session completions)
- Make learning feel collaborative rather than isolated

### Opportunity
Every interaction with Varsity Tutors is a potential viral moment:
- A student completes a practice test → could challenge a friend
- A parent sees progress → could share with another parent
- A tutor delivers a great session → could invite more families
- A student maintains a streak → could rescue a friend's streak
- A class is recorded → could become a watch party

## How It Should Work

### User Experience Flow

#### For Students
1. **During/After Learning**: Complete practice, session, or diagnostic
2. **Moment of Pride**: See results, achievement, or progress
3. **Social Cue**: System shows "28 peers practicing Algebra now" or "Your friend Sarah just joined"
4. **Viral Prompt**: "Challenge a friend to beat your score" or "Invite a study buddy"
5. **Reward**: Both get streak shields, AI minutes, or gems
6. **Tracking**: Friend receives deep link, joins, reaches FVM
7. **Loop**: Original student sees friend's progress, gets rewarded

#### For Parents
1. **Weekly Recap**: Receive progress summary with highlights
2. **Shareable Content**: Auto-generated privacy-safe reel (20-30s)
3. **Invite Prompt**: "Invite another parent for a class pass"
4. **Reward**: Both families get class sampler or AI tutor minutes
5. **Social Proof**: See other parents' children's progress (anonymized)

#### For Tutors
1. **After Session**: Receive 5★ rating or positive feedback
2. **Content Pack**: Auto-generated tutor card + prep pack
3. **Share Tools**: One-tap WhatsApp/SMS with smart links
4. **Referral Tracking**: Earn XP/leaderboard perks when referrals convert
5. **Attribution**: Clear dashboard showing referral impact

### Make Growth Feel Natural
- Prompts appear at natural moments (not intrusive)
- Copy is encouraging, not pushy
- Privacy is respected by default

## Problems We're Solving

### For Students
- **Loneliness**: Learning feels isolated → Make it feel social
- **Motivation**: Hard to maintain motivation alone → Add peer pressure (positive)
- **Help**: Stuck and don't know who to ask → Study buddy system
- **Competition**: Want to compete but no venue → Challenge system

### For Parents
- **Advocacy**: Proud of child's progress but no easy way to share → Shareable reels
- **Discovery**: Other parents don't know about Varsity Tutors → Invite system
- **Value**: Want to see value for money → Progress summaries + social proof

### For Tutors
- **Growth**: Tutors want to grow their client base → Referral system
- **Recognition**: Good tutors want recognition → Spotlight system
- **Efficiency**: Hard to market individually → Share packs and smart links
