# Active Context: 10x K Factor Project

## Current Phase
**All Phases Complete** - 10 of 10 phases completed. Production-ready system with full backend, frontend, database, API, and comprehensive testing.

## Immediate Focus
1. ✅ Phase 1-10: ALL PHASES COMPLETE
   - Foundation, loops, intelligence, alive layer, results sharing, supporting agents
   - Frontend development with React + TypeScript
   - Analytics dashboards with K-factor tracking
   - Compliance implementation (COPPA/FERPA)
   - Documentation, testing, and CI/CD
2. ✅ Testing and verification of all features
3. ✅ Comprehensive testing documentation

## Recent Decisions

### Viral Loops Selected ✅
- **4 loops implemented**: Buddy Challenge, Results Rally, Proud Parent, Streak Rescue
- Selected for broad persona coverage and high engagement potential
- All loops integrated and operational

### Technical Stack ✅
- **Language**: TypeScript (ES2022) with ES Modules
- **Protocol**: Model Context Protocol (MCP) pattern
- **Architecture**: Agent-based with event-driven design
- Event streaming: EventBus (ready for production service)
- Frontend: Ready for React/Vue/Next.js integration

### Agent Architecture
- MCP protocol for agent communication
- JSON Schema for contracts
- <150ms decision SLA
- Explainability required for all decisions

## Next Steps

### Completed ✅
1. ✅ PRD document complete
2. ✅ Task breakdown complete
3. ✅ .cursor/rules for project patterns
4. ✅ Agent contract schemas (JSON Schema)
5. ✅ 4 viral loops implemented
6. ✅ All agents implemented (Orchestrator, Personalization, Experimentation, Incentives, Tutor Advocacy, Trust & Safety)
7. ✅ Event schema and analytics
8. ✅ Session intelligence pipeline
9. ✅ Frontend UI with React
10. ✅ Database and API server
11. ✅ Testing scripts and documentation
12. ✅ CI/CD pipeline

### Optional Enhancements
1. Tutor Spotlight loop (optional)
2. Real-time push notifications
3. Advanced analytics visualizations
4. Multi-language support

## Active Considerations

### Ambiguous Elements (Need Decisions)
1. **Optimal Reward Mix**: 
   - AI minutes vs. gem boosts vs. class passes
   - By persona and CAC/LTV math
   - Need to define reward economics

2. **Leaderboard Fairness**:
   - New users vs. veterans
   - Age bands
   - Subject-specific vs. global

3. **Spam Thresholds**:
   - Caps on invites/day
   - Cool-down periods
   - School email handling

4. **K-factor Definition**:
   - Multi-touch attribution (view → sign-up → FVM)
   - Which events count toward K
   - Time windows for attribution

5. **Tutor Incentives**:
   - Reward structure for referrals
   - Disclosure requirements
   - Attribution rules

### Open Questions
- Which transcription service to use?
- How to handle session summarization at scale?
- What's the baseline referral rate to beat?
- How to handle edge cases (orphaned invites, duplicate accounts)?
- What's the acceptable latency for presence updates?

## Current Work Artifacts

### Created
- ✅ Memory bank structure (projectbrief.md, productContext.md, systemPatterns.md, techContext.md)
- ⏳ PRD document (in progress)
- ⏳ Task breakdown (in progress)

### Pending
- Agent contract schemas
- Event schema definitions
- Frontend component designs
- Compliance memo template
- Analytics dashboard designs

## Key Constraints

### Must Haves
- ≥ 4 viral loops functioning end-to-end
- ≥ 4 agentic actions (≥2 tutor, ≥2 student)
- MCP agents for required agents
- Measured K-factor with clear readout
- Presence UI and leaderboard demonstration
- Compliance memo approved
- Results-page sharing active

### Nice to Haves
- Additional viral loops beyond 4
- Advanced personalization
- Multi-language support
- Advanced fraud detection
- Real-time cohort rooms

## Success Criteria Reminder

### Primary Metrics
- K ≥ 1.20 for at least one loop (14-day cohort)
- +20% lift to FVM
- Referrals ≥ 30% of new weekly signups
- +10% D7 retention for referred cohorts
- +5% tutor utilization via referrals

### Quality Metrics
- ≥ 4.7/5 CSAT on loop prompts & rewards
- <0.5% fraudulent joins
- <1% opt-out from growth comms

## Notes
- This is a bootcamp project - balance ambition with deliverability
- Focus on thin-slice prototype that demonstrates core concepts
- Ensure all agents provide rationale for auditability
- Prioritize COPPA/FERPA compliance from day one
